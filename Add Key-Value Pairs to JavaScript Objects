//Basic Data Structures:
//Add Key-Value Pairs to JavaScript Objects
let foods = {
  apples: 25,
  oranges: 32,
  plums: 28
};

// example object['key'] = value;
//foods['bananas'] = 13;
//foods['grapes'] = 35;
//foods['strawberries'] = 27;

// alternate solution
foods.bananas = 13;
foods.grapes = 35;
foods.strawberries = 27;
// change code above this line
